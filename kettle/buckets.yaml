# A mapping of bucket URLs to bucket metadata.
#
# Possible bucket metadata:
#   contact: github name to contact
#   prefix: the identifier prefixed to jobs from this bucket (ends in :).
#   sequential: an optional boolean that indicates whether test runs in this
#     bucket are numbered sequentially. This is used for an optimization in the
#     collection phase, and defaults to true.
#   exclude_jobs: A list of job names that will not be uploaded to BQ
